Health Monitoring and Analysis using Python:

Overview
Health Monitoring and Analysis refers to the systematic use of health data to track and evaluate the wellbeing of individuals over time. This repository contains a comprehensive project in a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize health metrics. The project focuses on key parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, oxygen saturation, sleep quality, and stress level.

Dataset Description          
The dataset includes the following columns:

PatientID: Unique numerical identifier for each patient.
Age: Age of the patient in years.
Gender: Gender of the patient.
HeartRate: Heart rate in beats per minute.
BloodPressure: Blood pressure readings (formatted as systolic/diastolic).
RespiratoryRate: Respiratory rate in breaths per minute.
BodyTemperature: Body temperature in Fahrenheit.
ActivityLevel: Activity level during the measurement (e.g., resting, walking, running).
OxygenSaturation: Oxygen saturation percentage.
SleepQuality: Reported quality of sleep.
StressLevel: Reported level of stress.
Timestamp: Date and time of the measurement.
Project Objectives
Data Cleaning: Identify and fill missing values (using median imputation for body temperature and oxygen saturation).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Generate summary statistics for numerical features.
Visualize distributions using histograms, box plots, and heatmaps.
Visualization and Insights:
Analyze relationships between health metrics and factors like activity level, sleep quality, and stress level.
Group patients based on age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation to identify common health trends.
Patient Grouping: Categorize patients into groups such as Young, Middle-aged, and Senior; and label health conditions based on standard criteria.
Technologies Used:
    Python 3.x
    Jupyter Notebook
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
